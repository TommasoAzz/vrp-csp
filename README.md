# vrp-csp
Solution to the Constraint Satisfaction Problem "Vehicle Routing Problem" developed for the "Decision Making with Constraint Programming" course held by the University of Bologna in the CS Master degree.

## Content of the repository
The following content is available:
- a working model (`model.mzn`) that solves the problem
- some instances to test the model
- a project file that opens both the model and instances in [MiniZinc IDE](https://www.minizinc.org/)
- a folder `old_models` with previously developed and sadly ðŸ˜ª not working models
- a folder `project-report` with the report that was written to explain the development process, the ideas, the experiments and future work

## Requirements
The following tools are necessary for:
- trying the model: [MiniZinc](https://www.minizinc.org/software.html), which downloads both the MiniZinc environment and the MiniZinc IDE
- compiling the project report: [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), for which we advise the [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html) environment
