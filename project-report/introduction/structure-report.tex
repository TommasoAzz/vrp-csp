\subsection{Structure of the report}
\label{subsec:structure-report}
The report will have the following structure:
\begin{itemize}
    \item in \textbf{\hyperref[sec:introduction]{Section 1 - Introduction}} (the current one), the VRP problem gets presented and formally defined;
    \item in \textbf{\hyperref[sec:model]{Section 2 - Model}}, the formal definition gets applied for developing a mathematical model for solving the problem with \textit{Constraint Programming}; furthermore, details on the input data, the decision variables and the constraints will be presented;
    \item in \textbf{\hyperref[sec:experiments]{Section 3 - Experiments}}, the model gets implemented in a mathematical programming language and run with different instances, search strategies and timings, so as to understand how the model behaves with different instances and how the optimal solution changes over time;
    \item in \textbf{\hyperref[sec:conclusions]{Section 4 - Conclusions}}, the experiments get analysed to extract information on the best search strategies, issues with some instances and the best combinations of weights; moreover, some final thoughts on the project are discussed.
\end{itemize}
