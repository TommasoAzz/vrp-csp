\subsection{Structure of the report}
The report will have the following structure:
\begin{itemize}
    \item on Section 1 - Introduction (the current one), the VRP problem gets presented and formally defined;
    \item on Section 2 - Model, the formal definition gets applied for developing a mathematical model for solving the problem with Constraint Programming; furthermore, details on the input data, the decision variables and the constraints will be presented;
    \item on Section 3 - Experiments, the model gets implemented in a mathematical programming language and run with different instances, search strategies and timings, so as to understand the behaviour and how the optimal solution gets constructed over time;
    \item on Section 4 - Conclusions, the experiments get analysed to extract value and final thoughts on the project are discussed.
\end{itemize}
